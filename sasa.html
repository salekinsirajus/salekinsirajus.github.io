					This mission of the South Asian Students Association is to help promote an informed, multicultural society with an emphasis on social justice, education, and contribution to the South Asian cause.  The association will help integrate South Asian culture into the Earlham Community and also provide a place for South Asians to feel represented in their own unique cultures and traditions.  The association encourages an integration of not only South Asians but people of all nationalities, backgrounds and religions who are interested in the same ideals and values that the association attempts to embody.
